                <h2>OBSTACLE AVOIDANCE</h2>
                <div class="separetor2"></div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>
                The obstacle avoidance behavior was implemented in the double lane section of the course.
                The intended behavior was that the NEATO would change lanes to avoid an obstacle.
            </p>
            <p>
                To detect obstacles, we used the NEATO lidar data. As we only want to look at obstacles that are in
                front of the NEATO, we check the angles in front of the NEATO from -15 to 15 degrees. If the NEATO is
                able to detect more than 10 points that are less than 0.5 meters in front of it then an obstacle is
                considered detected.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once an obstacle is detected, the next step is to change lanes. The first step involved checking
                if the NEATO is in the left lane or right lane. I decided to do this by looking at the slope of the
                lane divider. If the slope of the line was positive, it meant the NEATO was in the right lane and
                vice versa for the left lane.
            </p>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <img src="template/images/left_lane.png">
                <p class="text-center">Left lane</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-6">
                <img src="template/images/right_lane.png">
                <p class="text-center">Right lane</p>
            </div>

            <p>
                In order to find the slope of the lane lines, we used color masking to isolate the rectangles of the
                lane dividers. Once that was done, I could use openCV to detect contours and find the centroid of
                each detected contours. There was some noise in this step of the process and we set a threshold area
                to filter out contours that were not a part of the lane divider. This codes snippet below shows how
                this was done:
            </p>
            <pre class="set-code-bg"><code>
                def filter_contours_find_centroids(self, contours, areas):
                """
                Filter contours that are too small and find the centroid of each one

                Args:
                contours: list of all the detected contours
                areas: list of corresponding area values for each contour
                """
                for idx,contour in enumerate(contours):
                    # check to see the areas are f
                    if areas[idx] > 200:
                        M = cv2.moments(contour)
                        cx = int(M['m10']/M['m00'])
                        cy = int(M['m01']/M['m00'])
                        # check that it is below some point because the lane lines are in the bottom half of image
                        if cy < 100:
                            self.centroids.append([cx, cy])
                            self.filtered_contours.append(contour)
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Once we knew which lane the NEATO was in, the last step was to actually move the NEATO into the other
                lane. I opted to use a simple method in order to do this by telling the NEATO to turn 90 degrees,
                drive half a meter and then turn 90 degrees in the opposite direction. I used the timing in order to
                control this movement.

                <h2>LANE FOLLOWING</h2>
                <div class="separetor2"></div>

        </div>
        <div class="row">
            <p>
                We wanted our robot to be able to traverse portions of the map autonomously, and to do this we
                needed to implement lane following. We decided to go for a vision based approach and rely solely on
                camera data for this component.
            </p>
            <p><b>Finding lines with Hough Line Transformation</b></p>
            <p>
                A critical part of lane following is accurately detecting the lane lines. We first preprocessed the
                image by converting it to grayscale since we will only need the luminance channel for detecting edges.
                We then applied a gaussian blur filter to it to decrease noise and reduce the number of false edges.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, using canny edge detection, we found all edges in the image. Notice that while the desired lane
                edges are detected, edges in the surrounding environment are also detected. To filter out the
                extraneous edges, we create a polygon segmenting off the approximate region of the image that contains
                the road. Edges detected within this region are most likely to be lane lines. This mask removed most
                of the extraneous edges other than the occasional tile edge detection.
            </p>
            <p>
                By applying hough line transformation on the filtered edges, we got a list of lines detected where
                each line is in the format of (x1, y1, x2, y2). To filter away the occasional vertical tile lines that
                were detected, we filtered for lines that were within a likely slope range for lane lines, which we
                approximated to be between [0.5, 2] after taking the absolute value.
            </p>

            <p><b>Finding Lane</b></p>
            <p>
                We then split the detected lines into 3 groups based on their slopes: left lane, right lane, and
                horizontal lanes.
                <br>
            </p>
            <li>Horizontal lane: m = 0</li>
            <li>Left lane: m > 0</li>
            <li>Right lane: m < 0</li>
            <br>
            <p>
                We then took the average slope and y intercept of each of these groups and calculated the line to
                represent each group.
            </p>
            <p><b>Lane Following Behavior</b></p>
            <p>
                For the lane following behavior, the neato needed to be able to stay in the center of the lanes while
                driving forwards and be able to turn when it reached a corner.
            </p>
            <p><i>Driving within the lane</i></p>
            <p>
                We use the left and right lane to determine whether weâ€™re driving centered in the lane. If both of
                the lanes are detected, we calculate the intersection point of the two lines. If the intersection
                point deviates from the approximate x center region of the frame, it means the neato is off center
                and needs to correct its path. If the intersection point is too far left, the robot is leaning right
                and needs to adjust leftward. Vice versa, if the intersection point is to the right, the robot needs
                to adjust rightward.
            </p>
            <p>
                In cases where only one lane is detected, we cannot calculate an intersection point and resort to
                using the slope of the available lane to determine the robot position. Through observing the slope
                of the lanes when the robot is driving centered, we know that the absolute value of the slope should
                be around 0.75 if the robot is centered. If the slope value deviates from this range, the neato needs
                to correct its path.
            </p>
            <p><i>Turning</i></p>
            <p>
                We use the horizontal lane to determine whether weâ€™re approaching a dead end on the map and need to
                make a 90-degree turn. If a horizontal line is detected and over a particular y threshold, it means
                that we're approaching a horizontal border and the robot should make a turn.
            </p>
            <p>
                There were several challenges with implementing this behavior:
            </p>
            <li>
                Before calibrating the camera, the horizontal lanes were curved which prevented them from being
                identified as horizontal.
            </li>
            <li>
                The robot would incorrectly detect horizontal tile lines and attempt to turn. To remedy this, we
                added a horizontal line counter that resets after each 90 degree turn. This counter keeps track of
                the number of horizontal lines detected and only if it is above a certain threshold (5) does it
                allow a turn. This decreases the likelihood of false positives.
            </li>
            <li>
                The robot would detect the horizontal lane lines at first, however, as it got close, it would veer
                off course and stop detecting the horizontal lane. We realized that this was because corners were
                rounded and the robot was following distorted left/right lane lines. We patched this issue by
                directing the robot to go straight if it detects an edge so it approaches the horizontal border head on.
            </li>
            <br>
            <p>
                So we now know when to turn 90 degrees, but which way should it turn? If there is an AprilTag at the
                intersection, it will provide the direction to turn. However, if there are no AprilTags, the turn
                direction is determined by the last lane detected. If the last detected lane is on the left, the left
                side is most likely blocked and the robot should turn right. This is true vice versa for if the last
                detected lane is on the right.
            </p>

            <p><b>Overview:</b><p>
            <p>
                The first step in our path planning is converting a map of our road to a representation that we can
            run path planning on. We pass in a list representing our grid, where a 1 means a square is open and 0
            means we cannot go there. This gets converted to a graph, where each habitable square is a node, and
            there are edges in between adjacent nodes. In addition, we pass in a list of the AprilTags and their
            locations. This is what that looks like:
            </p>
            <div class="row">
                <img class="center-img" src="template/images/path_grid.svg">
                <p class="text-center">A representation of the graph of our grid</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Once we have a graph representation, we can run our path planning algorithm to calculate a list of
                the nodes we need to traverse. We can run this as many times as we want to generate as long a path as
                desired. Once we have a complete path, we then run a self-designed algorithm to generate instructions
                for the robot. The instructions tell the robot which way to turn at intersections.
            </p>
            <p><b>Path-Planning Algorithm</b></p>
            <p>
                We used the A* algorithm to plan the path from point to point. The A* algorithm is a more efficient
                version of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, which is a common shortest path algorithm. Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm
                requires calculating the distance from the start node to every other node. In some implementations
                it stops once it reaches the end node, but it does not prioritize any node over any other node.
                The A* algorithm, however, calculates only the shortest path from the start node to the end, and uses
                some kind of metric to determine which nodes are the most likely. The metric we used was the Euclidean
                distance from a node to the goal.
            </p>
            <p>One iteration of our A* algorithm goes as follows: </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pop the first node off the list of open nodes. Because weâ€™ve sorted it, this node will have the
                    shortest estimated distance to the destination. This is part of what makes A* so useful.</li>
                <li>If the node is the end node, weâ€™re done! Otherwiseâ€¦</li>
                <li>Find all the nodes adjacent to the current node</li>
                <li>For each adjacent node:
                    <ol>
                        <li>Make sure we havenâ€™t seen it before</li>
                        <li>Set the current node to be the parent of this one</li>
                        <li>Check if this node is the end. If it is, weâ€™re done! Otherwiseâ€¦</li>
                        <li>Estimate the distance from this node to the end</li>
                        <li>If itâ€™s not already in our list to check from, add it</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add the current node to the set of nodes weâ€™ve already seen. This prevents us from processing
                    nodes multiple times
                </li>
                <li>
                    Sort the list of open nodes by estimated distance to the destination This means next time we pop
                    a node off the list, itâ€™s the one we think will get us there fastest.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Once weâ€™ve reached the destination, we trace from the end node back up to its parent node, from that
                node to its parent node, and so on until we reach the start node, which has no parent. Alternatively,
                if we process all the nodes and do not reach our destination, we know there is no path available and
                we throw an error.
            </p>
            <p><b>Instruction Algorithm</b></p>
            <p>
                Once we have a path, we need to generate instructions for the robot. We will know if a decision
                needs to be made if one of the nodes we are traversing has an AprilTag associated with it. This
                indicates an intersection. In order to know what to do at the intersection, we designed our own
                algorithm. The intuition is this:
            </p>
            <p>
                If we are currently at (2, 3), shown in red below, and have just come from (2, 2), shown in grey
                below, then our x coordinate has not changed, but our y coordinate has increased by one, as indicated
                by the deltas in the diagram. This means that we were traveling in the +y direction.
            </p>
            <div class="row">

                    The red node represents our current position, the grey node represents our <br>
                    previous position, and the pink nodes represent our three possible options. <br>
                    The circled node is our planned destination.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                In this case, we have three possible paths - left, right, or straight. If our next node is (2, 4),
                our delta x and y would not change. In this case that means delta x would still be 0 and delta y would
                still be 1. Since our deltas are the same as the previous node, we can tell that we want to go straight.
            </p>
            <p>
                If our next node were (1, 3), we would want to turn right. We can tell this because our x and y have
                switched from the previous node - now delta y is 0, which means we are going a different direction.
                Delta x being -1 indicates that we need to travel in the -x direction, so we need to turn left.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this diagram, our next node is (3, 3), as indicated by the outline. Again, we can tell that we need
                to change direction because delta y is now 0 and delta x is not. This time, delta x is positive, so we
                want to travel in the +x direction. In this case, that means turning right.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final piece of this puzzle is this: if we are traveling in the +y direction (down), then to
                travel in the -x direction we need to turn right. However, if we happened to approach this same
                intersection from the other direction, we would be traveling in the -y direction, and would need to
                turn left to travel in the -x direction. With this, we can generalize our solution to work for all
                squares on the grid traveling in any direction. We generate the instruction â€˜leftâ€™, â€˜rightâ€™ or
                â€˜straightâ€™, and associate it with the AprilTag that the robot should look for to perform this action.

                AprilTag detection goes hand in hand with the driving instructions output from path planning.
                In order for the Neato to be able to navigate the track, we placed AprilTag signposts at each
                intersection where the Neato could make a decision of either going straight, turning left, or
                turning right.
            </p>
            <p>
                In order to detect AprilTags from the camera input, we used a Detector object from the AprilTag Python
                library. Using this library, we could obtain the ID and tag size of any April tag within the Neato's
                view. We used the detected AprilTag size as a proxy for the distance between the Neato and the tag.
                As shown in the photo below, detected AprilTags, along with characteristics such as ID, size and
                associated instruction, are drawn onto the video window for ease of debugging. Though all detected
                AprilTags are drawn onto the screen, the target ID (according to the instruction currently being
                executed) is drawn in green.
            </p>

                <p class="text-center">On the left is an AprilTag is identified in the green outline</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                The size of the AprilTag was used to determine when the Neato should execute the current instruction.
                Until the size of the target AprilTag crosses some threshold value, the Neato continues with its
                default line-following behavior. Once the AprilTag reaches that threshold size, itâ€™s an indication
                that the Neato has reached that intersection and should begin executing the instruction. Using this
                picture as an example, the Neato is currently line-following and simultaneously detecting AprilTags in
                view. It sees an AprilTag with an ID of 2, and we can tell that itâ€™s associated with the current
                instruction because the markers are shown in green. The size of the AprilTag is currently 1444, though
                once it crosses some threshold value, it will begin to turn right and move on with the next instruction.

        <div class="row">
            <p>
                For this project, we decided to include three types of road signs:
            </p>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <img src="template/images/stopsign.jpg">
                <p class="text-center">Stop sign</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <img src="template/images/yield.jpg">
                <p class="text-center">Yield sign</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <img src="template/images/trafficlightaheadsign.jpg">
                <p class="text-center">Traffic light ahead sign</p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p>
                The reason we chose these road signs is because of our design decision to use color masking and shape
                classification as our method road sign detection. Yield, Stop and Traffic Light Ahead are all unique
                polygons that have a different number of vertices. The images below show the detected outline of the
                sign, how many polygon vertices it recognizes and what the resulting traffic sign is.
            </p>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <img src="template/images/stopsign.png">
                <p class="text-center">Stop sign</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <img src="template/images/yield.png">
                <p class="text-center">Yield sign</p>
            </div>
            <div class="col-sm-4">
                <img src="template/images/trafficlight.png">
                <p class="text-center">Traffic light ahead sign</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                How this interfaces with the broader road navigation project is in determining the Neatoâ€™s driving
                behavior at intersections where a traffic sign is detected. If the Neato spots a Yield or Stop sign,
                the Neato should come to a stop at the next intersection, check that there are no passing cars or
                pedestrians, and then keep going on its planned path. If the Neato spots a Traffic Light Ahead sign,
                it should enter traffic signal detection mode which uses color masking to detect when itâ€™s red,
                yellow, or green light. If itâ€™s a red light or yellow light, the Neato should stop at the next
                intersection and wait for the signal to turn green before continuing. If itâ€™s a green light, the
                Neato should keep on driving along its planned path.
            </p>
            <p>
                The image below shows road sign detection from the Neatoâ€™s camera input. The outline of the sign is
                drawn onto the video window in green, along with the sign type and number of vertices detected.
            </p>

                <p class="text-center">Detecting a yield sign</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                The GIF below shows the traffic sign detection behavior, where color masking is used to detect a
                green light. Using minimum and maximum bounds for the RGB values of this green color, we could create
                a binary window from the Neatoâ€™s camera input. If there is a large enough contour detected of this
                color, then that indicates the traffic signal is green and the Neato should keep driving. Otherwise,
                it should stop at the intersection and wait for a green contour to appear.
            </p>
